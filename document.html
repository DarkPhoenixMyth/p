   In the first project is about trying to hired at Tesla for a Software Position as well as showing my resume at the.
In this memo I gave my reason I why I am the perfect candidate for the position. 
One of ways I was able to show that in the memo was how I algin with them with their values. 
Tesla is determined to have a sustainable energy as well as being the future for self driving cars.

   This project was about creating an infrographic for the a company that you got hired from project two. In this project I did an infrographic about the Tesla Superchargers for new customers.
   I wanted to show for new customer how well connect the Superchargers are and how widespread the Superchargers are which can get rid of range anxiety for customer who want have road trips.

   This project was about creating a manual. The manual that I choose to create was about the fundamental of programming. I want to give a sense how important the fundamentals are as we professional might forget that and that could decrease our performance.
creating a manual for a programmer was hard as a there is not a right way to start or to end of our work. In the manual I suggest to test the code frequently as there is a higher possible chance to fix a bug immediate instead of trying to figure with function or which code is not working.

   This project was about creating a proprosal that would improve the company. My proprosal was about advancing the battery technology. Even though at the begining, Tesla so adhead of the competition almost no other car company was able to compete with Tesla.
   Unitl now, Chinese car companies are not only catching up but are also beating Tesla with the technology. One way of trying to complete with the Chinese car companies is research into different kinds of element would improve the battery's life and range.
   Also we would get professional research and we would university to help out with research.

    In the project, I found a good blog to take inspiration from, Smore Science Magazine, and based on their blog, I found strengths and weaknesses that helped me 
    create my blog that talks about the future of blogs. I talk about how blogs are still everywhere where even though they might not be the same as we used to think of 
    and how important it is to understand what make a good blog and use that in many other forms of media.

    In the second project, I created a pilot episode of a podcast talking about the history of AI and what will come in the future. I talk about how the AI has been we 
    us for a long time, but only recently has it become powerful. The goal of the podcast was to make sure people understood that AI has been with us for a long time and 
    what to expect from it. <br>

    <p>
    In the third project, I did a vodcast episode. In that episode, I looked at my gameplay in Rocket League and gave criticism on improving
     myself, but also other players too who want to get better at the game. I show a couple of clips of the mistake that I made during the game, 
     and in the video, I explain why I should not have made that mistake, why it happened, and the ways I should have played differently.  <br>

   <h2>Social Media Plan:</h2>
   <div class="textCenterImage">
    <p>
    In the final project, I worked on a business that needed help with its social media. I created a social media plan that would help them get
     more engagement, more followers, and more people to their business. One way I did it was I looked at one business that was similar to them 
     on the same level and how they use that to make their social media more interactive for their customer. A couple of things I did were expand 
     on their social media accounts for a bigger audience, create themed posts, and have a call to action.

   <h1>Reflection:</h1>
   <p>What most people think when someone says that they are an influencer they would probably think that the work is easy, but in reality, 
    the work takes a long time. Some people would think that you just sit on a screen a do nothing when the process of creating content takes a 
    long time because not you have to focus on planning the content, you have to also have to consider your audience. This portfolio is expected 
    in my career, so having more skills in communication, video, and planning in my portfolio would show my employer that I can put myself into the
     audienceâ€™s shoes and explore what they would want and what they do not want. As I am working on more projects throughout my career, my 
     portfolio would showcase the many skills that would have and not only that but also in case I forget how do to someone I can look back on my 
     portfolio to see what I did that helped or fix the problem and use it to my current project that I am working on. So next time someone tells 
     me that working on social media is easy will show them my portfolio and tell them the problems that I encounter, the solutions that I fix, 
     and my thought process on why I choose one method instill using another.  </p>
