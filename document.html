   This project was about creating a manual. The manual that I choose to create was about the fundamental of programming. I want to give a sense how important the fundamentals are as we professional might forget that and that could decrease our performance.
creating a manual for a programmer was hard as a there is not a right way to start or to end of our work. In the manual I suggest to test the code frequently as there is a higher possible chance to fix a bug immediate instead of trying to figure with function or which code is not working.

   This project was about creating a proprosal that would improve the company. My proprosal was about advancing the battery technology. Even though at the begining, Tesla so adhead of the competition almost no other car company was able to compete with Tesla.
   Unitl now, Chinese car companies are not only catching up but are also beating Tesla with the technology. One way of trying to complete with the Chinese car companies is research into different kinds of element would improve the battery's life and range.
   Also we would get professional research and we would university to help out with research.
